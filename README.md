# ClassChart

application to view a class inheritance tree containing the selected classes and their ancestors only

Edit the handler TForm1.FormCreate to add or remove a class to your selection, then compile and run the application to get the tree!

This example also shows, that classes in Object Pascal know their identity. Therefore you can request and use their type information at runtime. This is done here to build the inheritance tree.
